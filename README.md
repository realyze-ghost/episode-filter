# Simplistic Weather Forecast

A simple Hapi and react app that uses forecast.io and Google geolocation to
forecast weather.

It can also display a soothing photograph of Nicolas Cage. But that's just
a bonus feature, really.

### How do you install and run me?
Well, you know the usual drill:

    npm install
    npm start

Then go to `http://localhost:8000/public` in your browser.

Or open `http://localhost:8000/docs` to see the endpoints (generated by lout).

To run tests, do

    npm test

### Do I run anywhere?
Why, yes, I do! Go to http://simplistic-forecast.herokuapp.com/public/ and try
me out!

### Prerequisites

The app requires following env vars to be set:

 * `GOOGLE_API_KEY` - Your Google API key
 * `FORECAST_API_KEY` - forecast.io API key

And you can specify the port the server will run on via `PORT` env var.
